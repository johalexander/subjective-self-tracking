# subjective-self-tracking

How to map these unspoken measurements — surveys or questionnaires not enough or captures enough

What can the 1-clicker assist with, that questionnaires miss?

Better data visualisations for 1-button clicker

1-button clicker improvements (place?)

1-button clicker used with mental disorder (broad spectrum) patients
- PTSD covered
- Self harm?
- Urges
- Addiction
- Chronic pain?

Identifying triggers for anxiety, self harm or other phenomena from time series? 
- Chains of triggers

Feedback usages? Feeling of completion, feeling of safety, feeling of the device “taking on the anxiety”

Accessibility? Different feedback depending on use, disability; visual cue for non-feeling persons, vibration for feeling persons, auditory cue for hearing persons

Place approximation coupled with 1-click data

Collaboration with X hospital?

Snowball on previous works?

Hardware improvements of the 1-button clicker?

Bridging the gap for medical staff that are expected to use these tools, and interact with them

What complexities can you track with a single click?
- duration, fast, long
- sequence
- stop start
- chains
- periodic engagement

Next-Gen One Button Clicker Prototype
- Improving accessibility
- Multiple tracking modes — or datasets
- Failed to record data - error handling
- Place approximation
- Explorative data visualisations, with minimal setup
- Data extraction — ease of use — maybe wireless

Practical stuff
* Template for project description — how long, how detailed? Submit where?
* Signing up in course base / study planner

* Wifi sensor
* Accelerometer — is the device moving around?
    * Quantify usage
* Adafruit BNO055 Absolute Orientation
    * Giving the user ability to “mode” the device
    * Experiment
* S2 Feather ESP32-32

Device sprints!
- Time synchronization
- Place approximation
- “On-the-move”
- Tracking “modes”
- Button:
    - Force and duration

Data correlations to experiencing said phenomena more often during movement, and or if occurrences happen in defined places
