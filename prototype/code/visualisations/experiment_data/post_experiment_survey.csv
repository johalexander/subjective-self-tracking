You are asked by a health care provider to track the occurrences and severity (on a scale between 0-10) of your symptoms.

You have different analog and digital solutions offered to complete this task.

Notebook 
You write entries in a notebook, making sure to include date, time and severity of your symptom.

App on mobile
On each occurrence you open an app on your mobile phone to record severity of your symptom. Date and time is automatically recorded.

App on smart watch
On each occurrence you open an app on your smart watch to record severity of your symptom. Date and time is automatically recorded.

Physical device with arm elevation (adjusting pitch)
On each occurrence you elevate your arm to indicate severity, and press the button to record. Date and time is automatically recorded.

Physical device with wrist rotation (adjusting roll)
On each occurrence you rotate your arm to indicate severity, and press the button to record. Date and time is automatically recorded.

Which solution would you prefer to apply?"
